# MarcRover
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a different planets like Mars, Pluto etc.  You are responsible to land and operate the rovers sent for Mars plateau. This plateau, which is curiously flat and rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on- board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.  A rover's position is represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid of cells to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.  In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid cell, and maintain the same heading. Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).  Also assume that each cell size is 1 sq-cm and individual rover occupies the entire cell.
